I assumed that the contents will be displayed inside a grid which has 4 colums in a row

I also had put '/initialize_database' and and '/check_database' to check the status of database
I also had said "app.run(port=60051)" since without 'port=60051', pyhthonanywhere says me that "port 5000 is already in use"
